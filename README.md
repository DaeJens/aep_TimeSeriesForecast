# AEP Energy Consumption Time Series Forecast
### Overview
This project implements predictive analysis algorithms to forecast energy consumption patterns. By using historical hourly energy consumption data, the model predicts future energy usage in order to help with grid management and resource planning.
### Project Goals
- ***Primary Objective***: Develop and accurate time-series forecasting model for hourly energy consumption.
- ***Business Objective***: Enable better energy resource planning and grid management for power companies.
- ***Technical Objective***: Utilize predictive modeling to handle complex temporal patterns in energy usage.

### Key Results
- Energy consumption shows strong hourly and seasonal patterns.
- Time-based measurements effectively capture patterns in energy consumption.

### Impact
This forecasting model will better help power companies:
- Optimize resource planning by anticipating peak demand periods.
- Improve grid stability through predicting load patterns.
- Reduce cost through more efficient energy distribution.

### Future Directions
- Compare multiple agorithms to improve performance.
- Incorporate temperature and weather forecast data into analysis.
